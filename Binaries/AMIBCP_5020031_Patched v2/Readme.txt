- String Limitation Increased.
- Fixed Issue with String Packages, no removal needed.
- Fixed Saving without AMIBCP Crash.

Errors that still exist:
- The Text of some folders is empty.

In order to 100% ensure that no errors infiltrate the BIOS, setupdata should be replaced.
Works with Z300 Series and Z400 Series, i didnt tested z500.
